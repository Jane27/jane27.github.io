JavaScript, often abbreviated as "JS", is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted run-time language. It was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. In 1996 - 1997 JavaScript was taken to ECMA to carve out a standard specification, ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
